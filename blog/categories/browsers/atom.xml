    <updated>2012-10-17T12:48:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://tjvantoll.com/2012/10/17/maxlength-constraint-validation-oddities</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <code>maxlength</code> attribute has been around in browsers for a long time.  When provided all browsers prevent the user entering a value that exceeds the <code>maxlength</code>.</p>

<p>For example you cannot type more than 2 characters in the textbox below:</p>

<p><input type="text" maxlength="2" /></p>

<h3>Constraint Validation</h3>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/HTML5/Constraint_validation_">Constraint validation</a> is an HTML5 spec that provides native client side form validation in the browser.  As part of its <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Forms_in_HTML#Constraint_Validation_API">API</a>, all <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> elements have a <code>validity.tooLong</code> property that is <code>true</code> when the length of the <code>value</code> exceeds the <code>maxlength</code>.</p>

<p>But if the browser prevents this then why does the property exist?</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Prefilled value Attribute</h3>

<p>Assume that you're filling the <code>value</code> of form elements with information from a database and you end up with something like this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;input type="text" maxlength="1" value="ABC" /&gt;</code></p>

<p>How will the browser handle this?</p>

<p>All browsers will prevent entry of additional characters, but they do not trim excess characters already present.  Additionally all browsers will allow a form containing the above input to submit.  <em>Note: Opera is the only browser to set the <code>validity.tooLong</code> property to <code>true</code> in this situation.  Despite this, it does not prevent form submission.</em></p>

<p>Why is submission not prevented?  The key is in the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#concept-input-value-dirty-flag">specification</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Constraint validation: If an element has a maximum allowed value length, its dirty value flag is true, its value was last changed by a user edit (as opposed to a change made by a script), and the code-unit length of the element's value is greater than the element's maximum allowed value length, then the element is suffering from being too long.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#concept-input-value-dirty-flag">dirty flag</a> essentially means the the user has changed the value of an element.  Therefore, in order to be <code>tooLong</code> the element must have been last interacted with by a user edit.</p>

<h3>Actually Triggering tooLong</h3>

<p>So let's take another approach.  What happens if you have the same input:</p>

<p><code>&lt;input type="text" maxlength="1" value="ABC" /&gt;</code></p>

<p>...remove one character, then submit?  You can try it for yourself below:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 180px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/epCQe/embedded/result,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>Upon edit IE10 and Chrome will set the <code>validity.tooLong</code> property to <code>true</code> and prevent form submission.  If the user attempts to submit a form after removing the "C" they will see the following in those browsers:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-10-17/Chrome.png" title="Chrome" alt="Chrome" />
<img src="/images/posts/2012-10-17/IE10.png" title="IE10" alt="IE10" /></p>

<p>Firefox, Safari, and Opera incorrectly handle this situation and allow the form to be submitted anyways.</p>

    <link href="http://tjvantoll.com/2012/08/30/html5-form-validation-start-using-it-in-production-applications/"/>
    <updated>2012-08-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://tjvantoll.com/2012/08/30/html5-form-validation-start-using-it-in-production-applications</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Forms suck, yet, they make or break the most crucial online transactions.  Building web forms sucks as well; the APIs and lack of customizability has confused and frustrated people for years.  As a byproduct an abundance of horribly unusable forms have been created for everyone to suffer through.</p>

<p>Therefore <em>anything</em> that makes this process easier should be greeted with joy and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>HTML5 does just this by including a built in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Forms_in_HTML#Constraint_Validation_API">client side form validation mechanism</a> designed to make implementing client side validation powerful, seamless, and most importantly - easy to implement.</p>

<p>Great!  Despite this, HTML5 form validation is a topic relegated to presentations and demos; I personally have yet to fill out a web form in the wild that actually makes use of it.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Browser Support</h3>

<p>One reason people avoid HTML5 form validation is lack (or perceived lack) of browser support for the new APIs.  However the <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=form-validation">list of supported browsers</a> now includes the latest version of every major browser, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>IE 10</li>
<li>Firefox 4+</li>
<li>Chrome 10+</li>
<li>Safari 5+</li>
<li>Opera 10+</li>
<li>Opera Mobile</li>
<li>Chrome for Android</li>
<li>Firefox for Android</li>
</ul>


<h3>What to do in unsupported browsers?</h3>

<p>This is <em>the</em> problem.  Despite browser support being relatively good, for most sites there are still going to be a substantial amount of users with browsers that simply do not support the new APIs.  Therefore, if you are intending to support these users you have to start forking your code to support both browsers with native support and browsers without it.</p>

<p>While this can absolutely be done, it's time consuming and a bit of a nuisance.  It's faster and easier to simply ditch the native validation and use your own.  In this case you don't have to worry about multiple code paths; every user in every browser will hit the same codepath and get the same experience.</p>

<h3>What if we did nothing?</h3>

<p>But what if we took a new approach to this problem - simply don't do client side validation in unsupported browsers, at all.  This is advantageous for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>1) <strong>No dual maintenance</strong>.  One thing that has always bothered me about doing validation on both the client and server side is that you're validating the #1 principle of software development - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself"><strong>D</strong>on't <strong>R</strong>epeat <strong>Y</strong>ourself</a>.</p>

<p>2) <strong>No dependencies</strong>.  If you only use native browser APIs to provide client side validation you don't have to worry about maintaining plugin or library dependencies that might not be maintained.</p>

<p>3) <strong>Faster and easier</strong>.  The browser APIs are simple and easy to use.  Want to make a field required?  <a href="http://wufoo.com/html5/attributes/09-required.html">Add the <code>required</code> attribute</a>.  Want to make a field only accept email address?  <a href="http://wufoo.com/html5/types/1-email.html">Add <code>type=email</code> to your <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> field</a>.</p>

<p>4) <strong>Future Friendly</strong>.  Although currently a number of older browsers (namely IE &lt;= 9) do not support the new APIs, eventually they all will.  Therefore, eventually all users will hit the client side validation as intended.</p>

<h3>But, you can't just not validate data... right?</h3>

<p>Of course you have to validate client submitted data, but you already need to be doing that on the server side anyways.  What this approach requires you to do is simply return formatted error messages from your server side processing and <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/08/extensive-guide-web-form-usability/">display them in a usability friendly way</a>.  You're likely doing that already.</p>

<h3>What About Polyfills?</h3>

<p><a href="http://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill/">Polyfills</a> are great and a number of <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills">HTML5 form validation polyfills</a> exist.  My problem with polyfills in this case is that they add a dependency that I believe is unnecessary.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>HTML5 provides native solutions to validating client side data and most all modern browsers support it.  Yet, most people are still relying on the JavaScript hacks we've been using for well over a decade now.</p>

<p>It's time.  Come to the dark side.</p>

    <link href="http://tjvantoll.com/2012/08/19/onscroll-event-issues-on-mobile-browsers/"/>
    <updated>2012-08-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://tjvantoll.com/2012/08/19/onscroll-event-issues-on-mobile-browsers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All browsers fire an <code>onscroll</code> event on the <code>window</code> object whenever the window is scrolled.  On desktop browsers this event is fired continuously as the user scrolls, but on most all mobile browsers the event is not fired until the <em>scrolling action</em> comes to a complete stop.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>You can see this by scrolling in the example below:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/p4pww/13/embedded/result,html,js,css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>The <code>onscroll</code> event count and the value of <code>window.scrollY</code> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.scrollY">the number of pixels the document has been scrolled vertically</a>) displayed on the top of the screen in the example are updated in an <code>onscroll</code> event handler.</p>

<p>If you're viewing this on any desktop browser you'll see that as you scroll the <code>onscroll</code> event is continuously firing, <code>window.scrollY</code> is continuously updating, and the blue box (which is present so you can visibly tell whether the browser re-paints the screen) is continuously moving.</p>

<h3>Enter Mobile</h3>

<p>If you try the same demo on iOS Safari (5.0), the default Android browser &lt;= 2.3, Opera Mobile, or IE on Windows Phone 7 you'll notice something quite different.  As you scroll the <code>onscroll</code> event isn't fired, <code>window.scrollY</code> isn't updated, and the blue box does not move until the scrolling has come to a complete stop.</p>

<p>You can see this in the video below (the video shows iOS Safari but the same behavior occurs in the other listed browsers):</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5-vOJEP3x28" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<h3>Why</h3>

<p>These mobile browsers simply do not fire the <code>onscroll</code> event until scrolling has completely stopped.  This includes not only the touch based scrolling itself, but additionally any momentum that the user gives on the scroll.  The event will not fire until it stops.  This is a problem if you want to apply a visual change to the screen as the user scrolls.</p>

<h3>Other Mobile Browsers</h3>

<p>Firefox for Android does fire the <code>onscroll</code> event and updates <code>window.clientY</code> as you scroll, but strangely it doesn't re-paint the screen for any changes that have been applied.</p>

<p>The Android browser in Ice Cream Sandwich fires the event but doesn't feel very responsive and only sporadically re-paints the DOM to move the blue box.  Luckily, Jelly Bean's Android browser handles this example perfectly; everything is updated and rendered smoothly as the user scrolls.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>In my case I wanted to apply a change to the DOM for every pixel that the user scrolled, exactly like moving the blue box in the example above.</p>

<p>So the question is, can we work around this limitation and get desktop <code>onscroll</code> functionality in a mobile friendly way?</p>

<h3>Workaround Attempt - setInterval</h3>

<p>My first attempt was to set an interval that did what I wanted to do in the <code>onscroll</code> event.  Yes the code will run continuously instead of just when the user scrolls, but it's somewhere to start.</p>

<p>``` javascript
setInterval(function() {</p>

<pre><code>// Logic
</code></pre>

<p>}, 20);
```</p>

<p>The problem with this approach is that iOS Safari, Android &lt;= 2.3, and Opera Mobile do not run any functions queued through <code>setInterval</code> or <code>setTimeout</code> while a scroll is being performed.  The execution will simply be paused until the scroll has completed.</p>

<p>Here's an example that simply appends an asterisk to a div every 500 milliseconds using <code>setInterval</code>:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/NfkEg/7/embedded/result,js,html,css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>If you're viewing this in a desktop browser and you scroll, you can see that the asterisks will continue to be created.</p>

<p>However, on the affected mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android &lt;= 2.3, Opera Mobile), because the function queued through <code>setInterval</code> is paused, asterisk creation stops the moment you start scrolling and doesn't resume until you stop.</p>

<p>This video shows this behavior on iOS Safari (5.0):</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XkLvV9aPcYQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>This example works perfectly (scrolling doesn't stop asterisk creation) on the default Ice Cream Sandwich / Jelly Bean browser, Firefox for Android, and IE for Windows Phone 7.</p>

<h3>Workaround Attempt 2 - Use Touch Events</h3>

<p>Since the <code>setInterval</code> approach failed on the big mobile browsers my next thought was to use touch events instead.</p>

<p>Most mobile browsers fire <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2012/04/10/getting-touchy-about-patents/">Apple's flavor</a> of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Touch_events">touch events</a> as the user interacts with the screen via touch (the notable exception being Window's Mobile since Microsoft has their own touch model).</p>

<p>In particular the <code>ontouchmove</code> event is fired as the user moves their finger (or stylus, etc) across the screen.  Since users on touch devices need to move their finger across the screen to scroll, this seemed like the perfect alternative to <code>onscroll</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore I modified my example to use <code>ontouchmove</code> instead of <code>onscroll</code>:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/RFdve/10/embedded/result,js,html,css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>If you scroll on the above example on a desktop browser nothing will be updated since the counters are being driven by the <code>ontouchmove</code> event.  On mobile browsers a wide variety of things happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>Android: The <code>ontouchmove</code> event does get fired as the user moves the screen.  However the DOM updates are very sporadic and feel very jerky.  This is true of the default Android browser in Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich, and Jelly Bean although it gets better in later versions.</li>
<li>Firefox for Android: The <code>ontouchmove</code> events fires but DOM updates made in the <code>ontouchmove</code> event take effect sporadicly if at all.  Everything feels very jerky at best.</li>
<li>Opera Mobile: <code>ontouchmove</code> events occur but DOM changes are not applied until scrolling is complete.</li>
<li>iOS Safari: On <code>ontouchmove</code> event is fired as the screen is moved and the DOM does get re-painted.  This is only mobile browser where this approach made a substantial difference.</li>
</ul>


<p>One consistent issue with this approach is that the <code>ontouchmove</code> event is only fired when the user's finger remains on the screen.  Meaning, if the user gives any momentum to the scroll, <code>ontouchmove</code> events will not be fired while the window is scrolling and their finger is not on the screen.</p>

<p>You can see this in the video below:</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wied94KmwKw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>So what does all of this mean about using the <code>ontouchmove</code> event to mimic desktop <code>onscroll</code> functionality?   At the moment there are too many inconsistencies to rely on this behavior in any way.  If you only need to support iOS Safari this approach works reasonably.</p>

<h3>Workaround Attempt 3 - Don't <em>Really</em> Scroll</h3>

<p>Another <em>solution</em> out there is to disable native scrolling altogether and use JavaScript to mimic scrolling instead.</p>

<p>``` javascript
$('window').on('touchmove', function(event) {</p>

<pre><code>//Prevent the window from being scrolled.
event.preventDefault();

//Do something like call window.scrollTo to mimic the scrolling
//request the user made.
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>Unfortunately such techniques are usually utilized to create fixed height/width scrolling areas and are not intended (nor especially practical) for full screens.  If you are only interested in a scrolling event for a small section of the page you might want to look into something such as <a href="http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4">iScroll 4</a>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Unlike desktop browsers, most all mobile browsers simply do not fire an <code>onscroll</code> event until the scrolling action comes to a complete stop.</p>

<p>The only mobile browser that handled this event elegantly in my testing was Android's Jelly Bean browser.  Therefore, if you need any sort of cross browser support you're simply out of luck; there is simply no cross browser viable workaround to mimic the desktop behavior.  If you have had success implementing this by some other means please let me know in the comments.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>I haven't been able to test this in Chrome for Android and I know there are other mobile browsers that I'm missing.  If someone else has this capability I'd love to know how they handle these situations.</p>

<p>Also while I did verify these findings on physical devices for Firefox for Android, Android 2.3's default browser, and Safari on iOS 5; the rest of my testing was limited to simulators / emulators.  From past experience I know that simulator / emulator testing is no substitute for the real thing.  Therefore, if you find any discrepancies in my findings please let me know in the comments so I can update the post.</p>

    <link href="http://tjvantoll.com/2012/08/16/subpixel-animation-issues-in-ie-less-than-9/"/>
    <updated>2012-08-16T21:56:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://tjvantoll.com/2012/08/16/subpixel-animation-issues-in-ie-less-than-9</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While there are definitely <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/sub-pixel-problems-in-css/">cross browser discrepancies handling subpixels</a>, this one caught me by surprise.  Take the following:</p>

<p>``` html</p>

<div id="box"></div>


<script>
    var box = document.getElementById('box');
    box.style.left = '10.25px';
    console.log(box.style.left);
</script>


<p>```</p>

<p>This simply sets a value for the <code>left</code> CSS property then immediately retrieves it.  In Chrome 22, Firefox 14, Safari 6, Opera 12, IE >= 9, iOS 5, and Android <code>10.25px</code> will be logged.</p>

<p>In IE &lt; 9 <code>10px</code> is logged.  While not all browsers can accurately render the subpixel values, I had assumed all of them would've at least allowed the assignment.  I was wrong.  Internet Explorer will simply round the value to the nearest integer.</p>

<p>Why is this a problem?  <!--more-->Take the following code.</p>

<p>``` html</p>

<div id="box"></div>


<script>
    var box = document.getElementById('box');
    box.style.left = '0px';
    setInterval(function() {
        var currentLeft = box.style.left.replace('px', '');
        currentLeft = parseFloat(currentLeft);
        box.style.left = currentLeft + 0.25 + 'px';
    }, 20);
</script>


<p>```</p>

<p>This sets an interval that will increase the <code>left</code> property of a box by <code>0.25</code> pixels every 20 milliseconds.  Doing so will move the box left across the screen as seen below:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/PBsLt/9/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>Great.  Unfortunately in IE &lt; 9 the box will not move.  Within the interval function the value to increment is being retrieved from the element itself, which, in IE &lt; 9 will continuously return the rounded value.</p>

<p>The way around this is simply to use store off the value of the property outside of the animation loop itself.</p>

<p>``` html</p>

<div id="box"></div>


<script>
    var left = 0;
    var box = document.getElementById('box');
    setInterval(function() {
        box.style.left = left + 'px';
        left += 0.25;
    }, 20);
</script>


<p>```</p>

<p>This has the added benefit of being more efficient since you save a property retrieval on every invocation of the loop.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[HTML5 Form Validation - Showing All Error Messages]]></title>
    <link href="http://tjvantoll.com/2012/08/05/html5-form-validation-showing-all-error-messages/"/>
    <updated>2012-08-05T16:21:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://tjvantoll.com/2012/08/05/html5-form-validation-showing-all-error-messages</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=form-validation">Browsers that support HTML5 form validation</a> have one thing in common; if a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> is submitted and has errors on multiple fields, the browser will only display the first error to the user.</p>

<p>Turns out the spec leaves the specific means of handling multiple errors up to the browser itself:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Report the problems with the constraints of at least one of the elements given in unhandled invalid controls to the user. User agents may focus one of those elements in the process, by running the focusing steps for that element, and may change the scrolling position of the document, or perform some other action that brings the element to the user's attention.</p></p><p><p>User agents may report more than one constraint violation. User agents may coalesce related constraint violation reports if appropriate (e.g. if multiple radio buttons in a group are marked as required, only one error need be reported).</p><footer><strong>HTML5 Specification</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-constraint-validation-api'>www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>The key part here being that user agents (i.e. browsers) <strong>MAY</strong> report more than one constraint violation (i.e. error).  Turns out they all decided not to.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>You can see this in your browser below (assuming it <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=form-validation">supports HTML5 form validation</a> and is not Safari, more on that later).  Both fields are <code>required</code>, but if you submit the form you will only see an error for the first field.</p>

<pre class="codepen" data-type="result" data-href="FBGvu" data-user="tjvantoll" data-host="http://codepen.io"><code></code></pre>


<script async src="http://codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


<p>Here's what it looks like on supported browsers if you attempt to submit this empty <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>:</p>

<h5>Chrome 21</h5>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-08-05/Chrome.png" title="Chrome" alt="Chrome" /></p>

<h5>Firefox 14</h5>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-08-05/Firefox.png" title="Firefox" alt="Firefox" /></p>

<h5>Opera 12</h5>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-08-05/Opera.png" title="Opera" alt="Opera" /></p>

<p>As you can see, all three only give an error for the first field.  Firefox at least has the decency to put a red border around all fields with invalid data by default.</p>

<p>The one noticeable browser missing from the list above is Safari.  Even though Safari supports the constraint validation API, the validation itself is turned off.</p>

<h3>Usability</h3>

<p>From a usability perspective showing the users only the first error message is bad.  Imagine how frustrating it would be to continually correct errors just to be presented with the next error in the sequence.  If you've ran into a form such as this before you know what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>Luckily, browsers provide a <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-constraint-validation-api">constraint validation API</a> that can be used to provide this functionality.</p>

<h3>Using the Validation API</h3>

<p>All dom nodes now possess a <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#dom-cva-willvalidate_">willValidate</a> property that indicates whether the node is a candidate for form validation.</p>

<p>Nodes in which <code>willValidate</code> is <code>true</code> also have a <code>validity</code> property.  The <code>validity</code> property resolves to a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/ValidityState">ValidityState object</a> which contains information about whether the field has validation errors, as well as the error message the browser will display to the user.</p>

<p>To make things even easier browsers provide an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/:invalid">:invalid pseduoselector</a> that can be used to select all elements with validation errors.  Let's see how this can be leveraged to show all error messages.</p>

<h3>The Code</h3>

<p>Here's how I accomplished this with a jQuery dependent script.</p>

<p>``` html
<form></p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul class="errorMessages"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;label for="name"&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="text" required /&gt;

&lt;label for="comments"&gt;Comments:&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;textarea id="comments" required&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;

&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></form>​</p>

<script>
$(function() {
    var createAllErrors = function() {
        var form = $(this);
        var errorList = $('ul.errorMessages', form);
        
        var showAllErrorMessages = function() {
            errorList.empty();
            
            //Find all invalid fields within the form.
            form.find(':invalid').each(function(index, node) {

                //Find the field's corresponding label
                var label = $('label[for=' + node.id + ']');

                //Opera incorrectly does not fill the validationMessage property.
                var message = node.validationMessage || 'Invalid value.';
                errorList
                    .show()
                    .append('<li><span>' + label.html() + '</span> ' + message + '</li>');
            });
        };
        
        $('input[type=submit]', form).on('click', showAllErrorMessages);
        $('input[type=text]', form).on('keypress', function(event) {
            //keyCode 13 is Enter
            if (event.keyCode == 13) {
                showAllErrorMessages();
            }
        });
    };
    
    $('form').each(createAllErrors);

<p>You can see the results in your browser below:</p>

<pre class="codepen" data-type="result" data-href="eLvlf" data-user="tjvantoll" data-host="http://codepen.io"><code></code></pre>


<p>Here's how it looks in Chrome 21:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-08-05/Chrome-full.png" title="Chrome" alt="Chrome" /></p>

<p>A couple things to note:</p>

<p>1) If a user attempts to submit a form and gets validation errors, a <code>submit</code> event is never fired for the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>.  Therefore, instead of listening for <code>submit</code> on the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, I instead listen for a <code>click</code> on the <code>&lt;input type="submit"&gt;</code>.  Since the user is also able to submit the form pressing enter in text inputs, I attach a <code>keypress</code> listener to them to ensure the same logic runs.</p>

<p>2) In my example I start each error message with the contents of the field's <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>.  This is because the messages for each field are often identical.  An alternative approach would be to use another constraint validation API method, <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#dom-cva-setcustomvalidity">setCustomValidity</a> to set a completely custom message.</p>

<p>3) The <code>:invalid</code> selector will return nothing in all browsers that do not support the constraint validation API.  Therefore this code will simply do nothing in those browsers.</p>

<p>4) Opera incorrectly does not fill the <code>validationMessage</code> property.  Therefore the check <code>var message = node.validationMessage || 'Invalid value.'</code> is necessary so a message is displayed for Opera.</p>

<p>5) I do nothing to style the individual fields based on whether they have valid data.  The HTML5 spec provides a number of CSS hooks to do this and I would recommend reading <a href="http://html5doctor.com/css3-pseudo-classes-and-html5-forms/">CSS Pseudo-Classes and HTML5 Forms</a> from <a href="http://html5doctor.com">html5 Doctor</a> if you're interested in including such styling.</p>

<h3>That's a Lot of Code to Do Something Simple</h3>

<p>Yep.  While browser support is getting to be quite good for HTML5 forms the implementations themselves are still a bit buggy.  Nevertheless, this approach will work for displaying all validation errors to the end user.</p>

<h3>Polyfill</h3>

<p>If you are interested in making the code above work in all browsers one option you have is to polyfill the functionality for unsupported browsers.  One robust choice is the <a href="https://github.com/aFarkas/webshim">webshims</a> library.</p>

<p>To make webshims work with the code above all you need to do is add <code>$.webshims.polyfill('forms');</code>.  The maintainer, <a href="https://github.com/aFarkas">@aFarkas</a> was even kind of enough to provide me with a live example showing this - <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/trixta/HynHy/">http://jsfiddle.net/trixta/HynHy/</a>.</p>

<h3>Update (September 5th, 2012)</h3>

<p>Per some <a href="https://github.com/html5rocks/www.html5rocks.com/issues/175#issuecomment-8301873">critique on Github</a> from <a href="https://github.com/aFarkas">@aFarkas</a> I've made the following changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Updated the example code.

<ul>
<li>Removed a hack I had in place for Safari.</li>
<li>Switched to use the <code>:invalid</code> pseudoselector to find all invalid fields within a form.</li>
<li>Make the script handle multiple <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> elements in one DOM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added the above section on using webshim to polyfill this behavior for all browsers.</li>
</ul>
