    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All browsers will fire an <code>onscroll</code> event on the <code>window</code> object whenever the window is scrolled.  However, when and how often they fire the event varies greatly.</p>

<p>On desktop browsers this event is fired for every pixel the user scrolls.  But on most all mobile browsers the event is not fired until the <em>scrolling action</em> comes to a complete stop.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>You can see this by scrolling in the example below:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/p4pww/12/embedded/result,html,js,css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>The <code>onscroll</code> event count and the value of <code>window.scrollY</code> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.scrollY">the number of pixels the document has been scrolled vertically</a>) are updated in an <code>onscroll</code> event handler.</p>

<p>If you're viewing this on any desktop browser you'll see that as you scroll the <code>onscroll</code> event is continuously firing, <code>window.scrollY</code> is continuously updating, and the blue box (which is present so you can visibly tell whether the browser re-paints the screens) is continuously moving.</p>

<h3>Enter Mobile</h3>

<p>If you try the same demo on iOS Safari (5.0), the default Android browser &lt;= 2.3, Opera Mobile, or IE on Windows Phone 7 you'll notice something quite different.  As you scroll the <code>onscroll</code> event isn't fired, <code>window.scrollY</code> isn't updated, and the blue box does not move until the scrolling has come to a complete stop.</p>

<p>You can see this in the video below (the video shows iOS Safari but the same behavior occurs in the other listed browsers):</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8rk06wdLbKw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<h3>Why</h3>

<p>These mobile browsers simply do not fire the <code>onscroll</code> event until scrolling has completely stopped.  This includes not only the touch based scrolling itself, but additionally any momentum that the user gives on the scroll.  The event will not fire until it stops.  This is a problem if you want to apply a visual change to the screen as the user scrolls.</p>

<h3>Other Mobile Browsers</h3>

<p>Firefox for Android does fire the <code>onscroll</code> event and updates <code>window.clientY</code> as you scroll, but strangely it doesn't re-paint the screen for any changes that have been applied.</p>

<p>The Android browser in Ice Cream Sandwich fires the event but doesn't feel very responsive and only sporadically re-paints the DOM to move the blue box.  Thankfully, Jelly Bean's Android browser handles this example perfectly.  Everything is updated and rendered smoothly as the user scrolls exactly as desktop browsers do.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to test this in Chrome for Android and I know there are other mobile browsers that I'm missing.  If someone has this capability I'd love to know how they handle this situation.  Also some of my testing has been limited to simulators / emulators rather than actual devices.  If you notice any discrepancies with my findings please let me know in the comments so I can keep this post accurate.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>In my case I wanted to apply a change to the DOM for every pixel that the user scrolled, exactly like moving the blue box in the example above.</p>

<p>So the question is, can we work around this limitation and get desktop <code>onscroll</code> functionality in a mobile friendly way?</p>

<h3>Workaround Attempt - setInterval</h3>

<p>My first attempt was to set an interval that did what I wanted to do in the <code>onscroll</code> event.  Yes the code will run continuously instead of just when the user scrolls, but it's somewhere to start.</p>

<p>``` javascript
setInterval(function() {</p>

<pre><code>// Logic
</code></pre>

<p>}, 20);
```</p>

<p>The problem with this approach is that iOS Safari, Android &lt;= 2.3, and Opera Mobile do not run any functions queued through <code>setInterval</code> or <code>setTimeout</code> while a scroll is being performed.  The execution will simply be paused until the scroll has completed.</p>

<p>Here's an example that simply appends an asterisk to a div every 500 milliseconds using <code>setInterval</code>:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/NfkEg/7/embedded/result,js,html,css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>If you're viewing this in a desktop browser and you scroll, you can see that the asterisks will continue to be created.</p>

<p>However, on the affected mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android &lt;= 2.3, Opera Mobile), because the function queued through <code>setInterval</code> is paused, asterisk creation stops the moment you start scrolling and doesn't resume until you stop.</p>

<p>This video shows this behavior on iOS Safari (5.0):</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XkLvV9aPcYQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>This example works perfectly (scrolling doesn't stop asterisk creation) on the default Ice Cream Sandwich / Jelly Bean browser, Firefox for Android, and IE for Windows Phone 7.</p>

<h3>Workaround Attempt 2 - Use Touch Events</h3>

<p>Since the <code>setInterval</code> approach failed on the big mobile browsers my next thought was to use touch events instead.</p>

<p>Most mobile browsers fire <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2012/04/10/getting-touchy-about-patents/">Apple's flavor</a> of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Touch_events">touch events</a> as the user interacts with the screen via touch (the notable exception being Window's Mobile since Microsoft has their own touch model).</p>

<p>In particular the <code>ontouchmove</code> event is fired as the user moves their finger (or stylus, etc) across the screen.  Since users on touch devices need to move their finger across the screen to scroll, this seemed like the perfect alternative to <code>onscroll</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore I modified my example to use <code>ontouchmove</code> instead of <code>onscroll</code>:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/RFdve/9/embedded/result,js,html,css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>If you try to scroll this example on a desktop browser nothing will happen since everything is now being driven by the <code>ontouchmove</code> event.  On mobile browsers a wide variety of things happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>Android: The <code>ontouchmove</code> event does get fired as the user moves the screen.  However the DOM updates are very sporadic and feel very jerky.  This is true of the default Android browser in Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich, and Jelly Bean although it gets better in later versions.</li>
<li>Firefox for Android: The <code>ontouchmove</code> events fires but DOM updates made in the <code>ontouchmove</code> event take effect sporadicly if at all.  Everything feels very jerky at best.</li>
<li>Opera Mobile: <code>ontouchmove</code> events occur but DOM changes are not applied until scrolling is complete.</li>
<li>iOS Safari: On <code>ontouchmove</code> event is fired as the screen is moved and the DOM does get re-painted.  This is only mobile browser where this approach made a substantial difference.</li>
</ul>


<p>One consistent issue with this approach is that the <code>ontouchmove</code> event is only fired when the user's finger remains on the screen.  Meaning, if the user gives any momentum to the scroll, <code>ontouchmove</code> events will not be fired as the screen when the user's finger is not on the screen.</p>

<p>You can see this in the video below:</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bPWtg0mn7Sk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>So what does all of this mean about using the <code>ontouchmove</code> event to mimic desktop <code>onscroll</code> functionality?   At the moment there are too many inconsistencies to rely on this behavior in any way.  If you only need to support iOS Safari this approach works reasonably.</p>

<h3>Workaround Attempt 3 - Don't <em>Really</em> Scroll</h3>

<p>Another <em>solution</em> out there is to disable native scrolling altogether and use JavaScript to mimic scrolling instead.</p>

<p>``` javascript
$('window').on('touchmove', function(event) {</p>

<pre><code>//Prevent the window from being scrolled.
event.preventDefault();

//Do something like call window.scrollTo to mimic the scrolling
//request the user made.
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>Unfortunately such techniques are usually utilized to create fixed height/width scrolling areas and are not intended (nor especially practical) for full screens.  If you are only interested in a scrolling event for a small section of the page you might want to look into something such as <a href="http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4">iScroll 4</a>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Unlike desktop browsers, most all mobile browsers simply do not fire an <code>onscroll</code> event until the scrolling action comes to a complete stop.</p>

<p>If you only need to support Android's Jelly Bean browser the <code>onscroll</code> event works beautifully and behaves just like desktop browsers.  If you only need to support iOS Safari using the <code>ontouchmove</code> event to mimic Desktop <code>onscroll</code> events mostly works.</p>

<p>If you need any sort of cross browser support you're simply out of luck.  At this point there is simply no cross browser viable workaround to mimic the desktop behavior.  If you had success implementing this by some other means let me know in the comments.</p>

    <link href="http://tjvantoll.com/2012/08/16/subpixel-animation-issues-in-ie-less-than-9/"/>
    <updated>2012-08-16T21:56:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://tjvantoll.com/2012/08/16/subpixel-animation-issues-in-ie-less-than-9</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While there are definitely <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/sub-pixel-problems-in-css/">cross browser discrepancies handling subpixels</a>, this one caught me by surprise.  Take the following:</p>

<p>``` html</p>

<div id="box"></div>


<script>
    var box = document.getElementById('box');
    box.style.left = '10.25px';
    console.log(box.style.left);
</script>


<p>```</p>

<p>This simply sets a value for the <code>left</code> CSS property then immediately retrieves it.  In Chrome 22, Firefox 14, Safari 6, Opera 12, IE >= 9, iOS 5, and Android <code>10.25px</code> will be logged.</p>

<p>In IE &lt; 9 <code>10px</code> is logged.  While not all browsers can accurately render the subpixel values, I had assumed all of them would've at least allowed the assignment.  I was wrong.  Internet Explorer will simply round the value to the nearest integer.</p>

<p>Why is this a problem?  <!--more-->Take the following code.</p>

<p>``` html</p>

<div id="box"></div>


<script>
    var box = document.getElementById('box');
    box.style.left = '0px';
    setInterval(function() {
        var currentLeft = box.style.left.replace('px', '');
        currentLeft = parseFloat(currentLeft);
        box.style.left = currentLeft + 0.25 + 'px';
    }, 20);
</script>


<p>```</p>

<p>This sets an interval that will increase the <code>left</code> property of a box by <code>0.25</code> pixels every 20 milliseconds.  Doing so will move the box left across the screen as seen below:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/PBsLt/9/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>Great.  Unfortunately in IE &lt; 9 the box will not move.  Within the interval function the value to increment is being retrieved from the element itself, which, in IE &lt; 9 will continuously return the rounded value.</p>

<p>The way around this is simply to use store off the value of the property outside of the animation loop itself.</p>

<p>``` html</p>

<div id="box"></div>


<script>
    var left = 0;
    var box = document.getElementById('box');
    setInterval(function() {
        box.style.left = left + 'px';
        left += 0.25;
    }, 20);
</script>


<p>```</p>

<p>This has the added benefit of being more efficient since you save a property retrieval on every invocation of the loop.</p>

    <link href="http://tjvantoll.com/2012/08/05/html5-form-validation-showing-all-error-messages/"/>
    <updated>2012-08-05T16:21:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://tjvantoll.com/2012/08/05/html5-form-validation-showing-all-error-messages</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=form-validation">Browsers that support HTML5 form validation</a> have one thing in common; if a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> is submitted and has errors on multiple fields, the browser will only display the first error to the user.</p>

<p>Turns out the spec leaves the specific means of handling multiple errors up to the browser itself:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Report the problems with the constraints of at least one of the elements given in unhandled invalid controls to the user. User agents may focus one of those elements in the process, by running the focusing steps for that element, and may change the scrolling position of the document, or perform some other action that brings the element to the user's attention.</p></p><p><p>User agents may report more than one constraint violation. User agents may coalesce related constraint violation reports if appropriate (e.g. if multiple radio buttons in a group are marked as required, only one error need be reported).</p><footer><strong>HTML5 Specification</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-constraint-validation-api'>www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>The key part here being that user agents (i.e. browsers) <strong>MAY</strong> report more than one constraint violation (i.e. error).  Turns out they all decided not to.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>You can see this in your browser below (assuming it <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=form-validation">supports HTML5 form validation</a> and is not Safari, more on that later).  Both fields are <code>required</code>, but if you submit the form you will only see an error for the first field.</p>

<pre class="codepen" data-type="result" data-href="FBGvu" data-user="tjvantoll" data-host="http://codepen.io"><code></code></pre>


<script async src="http://codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


<p>Here's what it looks like on supported browsers if you attempt to submit this empty <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>:</p>

<h5>Chrome 21</h5>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-08-05/Chrome.png" title="Chrome" alt="Chrome" /></p>

<h5>Firefox 14</h5>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-08-05/Firefox.png" title="Firefox" alt="Firefox" /></p>

<h5>Opera 12</h5>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-08-05/Opera.png" title="Opera" alt="Opera" /></p>

<p>As you can see, all three only give an error for the first field.  Firefox at least has the decency to put a red border around all fields with invalid data by default.</p>

<p>The one noticeable browser missing from the list above is Safari.  Even though Safari supports the constraint validation API, the validation itself is turned off.</p>

<h3>Usability</h3>

<p>From a usability perspective showing the users only the first error message is bad.  Imagine how frustrating it would be to continually correct errors just to be presented with the next error in the sequence.  If you've ran into a form such as this before you know what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>Luckily, browsers provide a <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-constraint-validation-api">constraint validation API</a> that can be used to provide this functionality.</p>

<h3>Using the Validation API</h3>

<p>All dom nodes now possess a <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#dom-cva-willvalidate_">willValidate</a> property that indicates whether the node is a candidate for form validation.</p>

<p>Nodes in which <code>willValidate</code> is <code>true</code> also have a <code>validity</code> property.  The <code>validity</code> property resolves to a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/ValidityState">ValidityState object</a> which contains information about whether the field has validation errors, as well as the error message the browser will display to the user.  You can leverage this API to display all error messages whenever a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> is submitted.</p>

<h3>The Code</h3>

<p>Here's how I accomplished this with a jQuery dependent script.</p>

<p>``` html
<form></p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id="errorMessages"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;label for="name"&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="text" required /&gt;

&lt;label for="comments"&gt;Comments:&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;textarea id="comments" required&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;

&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></form>​</p>

<script>
$(function() {
    //Keep track of whether there are any errors on the form for Safari.
    var formHasErrors = false;
    
    var showAllErrorMessages = function() {
        $('#errorMessages').empty();
        formHasErrors = false;

        //Find everything within the form
        $('form').find('*').each(function(index, node) {
            if (node.willValidate && node.validity && !node.validity.valid) {
                formHasErrors = true;
                //Find the field's corresponding label
                var label = $('label[for=' + node.id + ']');
                
                //Opera incorrectly does not fill the validationMessage property.
                var message = node.validationMessage || 'Invalid value.';
                $('#errorMessages')
                    .show()
                    .append('<li><span>' + label.html() + '</span> ' + message + '</li>');                                       
            }
        });
    };
    
    $('input[type=submit]').on('click', showAllErrorMessages);
    $('input[type=text]').on('keypress', function(event) {
        //keyCode 13 is Enter
        if (event.keyCode == 13) {
            showAllErrorMessages();
        }
    });
    
    //Handle for Safari not having HTML5 form validation active.
    $('form').on('submit', function(event) {
        if (formHasErrors) {
            event.preventDefault();
        }
    });
});​
</script>


<p>```</p>

<p>You can see the results in your browser below:</p>

<pre class="codepen" data-type="result" data-href="eLvlf" data-user="tjvantoll" data-host="http://codepen.io"><code></code></pre>


<p>Here's how it looks in Chrome 21:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-08-05/Chrome-full.png" title="Chrome" alt="Chrome" /></p>

<p>A couple things to note:</p>

<p>1) If a user attempts to submit a form and gets validation errors, a <code>submit</code> event is never fired for the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>.  Therefore, instead of listening for <code>submit</code> on the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, I instead listen for a <code>click</code> on the <code>&lt;input type="submit"&gt;</code>.  Since the user is also able to submit the form pressing enter in text inputs, I attach a <code>keypress</code> listener to them to ensure the same logic runs.</p>

<p>2) In my example I start each error message with the contents of the field's <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>.  This is because the messages for each field are often identical.  An alternative approach would be to use another constraint validation API method, <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#dom-cva-setcustomvalidity">setCustomValidity</a> to set a completely custom message.</p>

<p>3) The <code>node.willValidate &amp;&amp; node.validity</code> check will be <code>false</code> in all browsers that do not support the constraint validation API.  Therefore this code will simply do nothing in browsers that do not support HTML5 form validation.</p>

<p>4) Opera incorrectly does not fill the <code>validationMessage</code> property.  Therefore the check <code>var message = node.validationMessage || 'Invalid value.'</code> is necessary so a message is displayed for Opera.</p>

<p>5) In order to make Safari display the error messages I manually keep track of whether there are any validation errors in the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>.  If there are I prevent the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> from submitting in a <code>submit</code> event.</p>

<p>6) I do nothing to style the individual fields based on whether they have valid data.  The HTML5 spec provides a number of CSS hooks to do this and I would recommend reading <a href="http://html5doctor.com/css3-pseudo-classes-and-html5-forms/">CSS Pseudo-Classes and HTML5 Forms</a> from <a href="http://html5doctor.com">html5 Doctor</a> if you're interested in including such styling.</p>

<h3>That's a Lot of Code to Do Something Simple</h3>

<p>Yep.  While browser support is getting to be quite good for HTML5 forms the implementations themselves are still a bit buggy.  Nevertheless, this approach will work for displaying all validation errors to the end user.</p>

    <updated>2012-07-19T22:33:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://tjvantoll.com/2012/07/19/dom-element-references-as-global-variables</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Quiz: What is logged when the following markup is rendered?</p>

<p>``` html
<html></p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;button id="bar"&gt;Button&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        console.log(bar);
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></html>
```</p>

<p>Syntax error obviously, right?  Wrong.  All major browser rendering engines will log a reference to the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> node.  This includes Trident (IE), Gecko (Firefox), WebKit (Chrome, Safari, etc), and Presto (Opera).</p>

<h3>Wait.  What?</h3>

<p>Ah, I get it, there's no doctype on that markup.  So this a quirks mode only thing then right?  Wrong.  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622491">As of Firefox 14</a> the latest version of all major browsers will produce the same result IN STANDARDS MODE.</p>

<p>``` html
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
<html></p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;button id="bar"&gt;Button&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        console.log(bar); //Reference to &lt;button&gt;, even in standards mode
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></html>
```</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>So What's Going On?</h3>

<p>Believe it or not this is actually correct behavior per the HTML specification.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>6.2.4 Named access on the Window object</p></p><p><p>The Window interface supports named properties. The supported property names at any moment consist of:</p></p><p><blockquote><p>the value of the name content attribute for all a, applet, area, embed, form, frame, frameset, iframe, img, and object elements in the active document that have a name content attribute, and<br/>the value of the id content attribute of any HTML element in the active document with an id content attribute.</p><footer><strong>HTML Specification</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#named-access-on-the-window-object'>www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p></blockquote>

<p>What this is saying is that the value of the <code>name</code> attribute of certain elements and the value of the <code>id</code> attribute of ALL elements are accessible via the <code>window</code> object in the browser.  So, if you have a node <code>&lt;button id="foo"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</code>, then <code>window.foo</code> will be resolved to a reference to the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>.  From this point forward I will refer to this behavior as named access.</p>

<h3>How is This Standard Behavior?</h3>

<p>This behavior is an old Internet Explorer <em>feature</em>.  I can only imagine that it was intended to be a convenience for web developers that got sick of typing <code>document.getElementById</code> over and over again.  (this is way before jQuery and other popular toolkits came to be).  Regardless of the reasoning, IE shipped with this functionality and a whole lot of people utilized it.</p>

<p>Other rendering engines were faced with the difficult decision of implementing non-standard behavior or remaining incompatible with a slew of websites written specifically for Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>Gecko implemented this functionality but originally turned it on only in quirks mode.  They recently took the extra step and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622491">turned named access on in standards mode with Firefox 14</a>.</p>

<p>Webkit and Presto have had named access in standards mode for some time now.  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=11960">Webkit recently considered relegating this behavior to quirks mode</a>, however, they decided on leaving it enabled in standards mode.  Apparently there is still just too much stuff out there relying on this behavior to remove it in standards mode.  Believe it or not Microsoft even <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=737760">shipped a marketing demo</a> that directly referenced named DOM elements, preventing it from functioning in Gecko.</p>

<p>One of the main aims of the HTML5 specification is to standardize browser behavior, however quirky it might be.  Therefore, this functionality made it into the specification.</p>

<h3>Why is This Behavior Bad?</h3>

<p>I've alluded to the fact that this behavior is bad, but I've haven't gotten into details as to why.</p>

<h4>There is a high potential for bugs to be introduced into the system</h4>

<p>Let's say you have some code that looks something like this:</p>

<p>``` html
<html></p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" id="choice"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        var choice = 'foo';
        //Lots more JavaScript
        doSomethingVeryComplicated(choice);
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></html>
```</p>

<p>Since a global <code>choice</code> variable is being created, <code>window.choice</code> will resolve to the string <code>foo</code> and not a reference to the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>.  This is because the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> reference is being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing">shadowed</a> by the variable declaration.  This works the same way as a variable with the same name being declared in a nested function.</p>

<p>``` javascript
(function() {</p>

<pre><code>var x = 2;
var y = function() {
    var x = 3;
    //Logs 3 instead of 2 because the value defined in the outer
    //function is shadowed by the x defined in the inner function.
    console.log(x);
};
y();
</code></pre>

<p>}());
```</p>

<p>This is all well and good.  However, let's say that during a refactor of this code the <code>var choice = 'foo';</code> line is accidentally removed.  Under normal circumstances this would cause a syntax error because <code>window.choice</code> would now be undefined.  However, because there is a DOM node with an <code>id</code> of <code>choice</code>, that reference will now refer to the DOM node instead.  This can easily lead to unexpected behavior.</p>

<p>The flip side of this situation is also true.  If you have an element <code>&lt;div id="bar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> and use <code>window.bar</code> to refer to it, that code will break if you create JavaScript variable using <code>var</code> in the same scope (i.e. <code>var bar = 2;</code>).</p>

<h4>Mistyping</h4>

<p>Say you mistype the name of your variable and happen to type a named DOM element.  SURPRISE!</p>

<h4>Non-trivial cost for the browser to implement</h4>

<p>In order for these named elements to be available, the browser has to create a list of all named elements and maintain it as the page changes.  I can't offer any specific metrics as to how much time and memory this takes, but there is a cost, especially on pages with a large number of named elements.</p>

<h4>Named elements will be shadowed by properties natively defined on <code>window</code>.</h4>

<p>If you <em>were</em> to go the route of using named access you'd have to be careful to avoid using named elements with values that are predefined on the <code>window</code> already.</p>

<p>For example you cannot refer to a <code>&lt;input id="location"&gt;</code> by <code>window.location</code> because that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location">already resolves to an object</a> with information about the URL of the current document.</p>

<p>There are a number of other property names on the <code>window</code> object that you could easily see being used to name a DOM element - <code>event</code>, <code>history</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>self</code>, <code>status</code>, and <code>toolbar</code> to name a few.</p>

<h4>Browsers have inconsistent implementations.</h4>

<p>Even though this is behavior is now standardized, there are still browser quirks in the way named access is implemented.</p>

<h5>IE and Form Elements</h5>

<p>IE will (incorrectly) make the <code>name</code> attribute of form elements available on the <code>window</code> object.</p>

<p>``` html
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
<html></p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;form&gt;
        &lt;input name="foo" /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        //Logs a reference to the &lt;input&gt; in IE.
        //Syntax error in all other rendering engines.
        console.log(foo);
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></html>
```</p>

<h5>Name Attribute on Anchor Tags</h5>

<p>Per the spec, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags should be accessible on the <code>window</code> object via the value of their <code>name</code> attribute.  However, this only works in IE and Opera.</p>

<p>``` html
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
<html></p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;a name="foo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        //Logs a reference to the &lt;a&gt; in IE and Opera.
        //Syntax error in Gecko and WebKit.
        console.log(foo);
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></html>
```</p>

<h5>Multiple Named Attributes with the Same Value</h5>

<p>Per this portion of the spec:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>...if elements has only one element, return that element and abort these steps.</p></p><p><p>Otherwise return an HTMLCollection rooted at the Document node, whose filter matches only named elements with the name name.</p><footer><strong>HTML Specification</strong> <cite><a href='http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/single-page.html#dom-window-nameditem'>dev.w3.org/html5/spec/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>What this is staying is that when there are multiple named properties with the same name, the browser should return an array when that property is referenced (instead of a reference to a specific DOM node).  As an example given this markup:</p>

<p>``` html
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
<html></p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;input id="one"&gt;
    &lt;input id="one"&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        console.log(one);
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></html>
```</p>

<p>...an array with references to the two <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> nodes should be logged per the spec.  And it will be in all browsers except Firefox.  Firefox 14 will simply log the first element.</p>

<p>Having two elements with the same <code>id</code> is invalid HTML, but the browser will still render it just fine.  Even with the best of intentions these sorts of things do happen, especially in larger, dynamic applications.</p>

<h3>More?</h3>

<p>These are simply the bugs that I've ran into, I'm sure there are more.  If you know of any let me know in the comments and I can update this list.</p>

<h3>But won't strict mode prevent this?</h3>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Strict_mode">ECMAScript 5 strict mode</a> prevents you assigning values to variables before they are declared.  Therefore this...</p>

<p>``` javascript
(function() {</p>

<pre><code>foo = 2; 
</code></pre>

<p>}());
```</p>

<p>will execute just fine whereas this...</p>

<p>``` javascript
(function() {</p>

<pre><code>'use strict';
foo = 2; 
</code></pre>

<p>}());
```</p>

<p>...will produce a syntax error that <code>foo</code> is not defined.  This is great, but it will not stop you from accessing named properties on the <code>window</code> object.</p>

<p>``` html</p>

<div id="foo"></div>


<script>
    (function() {
        'use strict';
        console.log(foo);
    });
</script>


<p>```</p>

<p>This will log a reference to the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in standards mode in the latest version of all modern browsers.  Strict mode will only prevent you from assigning values to variables that have yet to be declared.  If you're simply using a variable then strict mode doesn't protect you.  Therefore, you're not prevented from accessing name properties on the global <code>window</code> object.</p>

<h3>What to do instead</h3>

<p>Use <code>document.getElementById</code> to retrieve references to DOM nodes via their <code>id</code> attribute.</p>

<p>``` html
<button id="foo"></button></p>

<script>
    document.getElementById('foo');
</script>


<p>```</p>

<p>To get a reference to a DOM node via its <code>name</code> attribute you can use <code>document.querySelectorAll</code>.</p>

<p>``` html
<a name="bar"></a></p>

<script>
    document.querySelectorAll('[name=bar]');
</script>


<p>```</p>

<p><code>document.querySelectorAll</code> is not safe to use in IE &lt;= 8, so if you need to support older IE look into using a toolkit such as <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> to select the DOM nodes that you need.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>All major browsers now make named properties available on the global <code>window</code> object in standards mode.  It's important to know that browsers do this because you'll likely run into this at some point.  However, never purposely utilize this functionality.  If you see others use it tell them to stop, ridicule them, do whatever it takes.  Help <a href="http://movethewebforward.org/">move the web forward</a>.</p>

    <updated>2012-07-15T21:07:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://tjvantoll.com/2012/07/15/native-html5-number-picker-vs-jquery-uis-spinner-which-to-use</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/number-state.html#number-state">HTML5's native number picker</a> (<code>&lt;input[type=number]</code>) and jQuery UI 1.9's spinner can both be used to create inputs for numeric data.  So which makes sense for your application?  Let's start with a brief explanation of each.</p>

<h3><code>input[type=number]</code></h3>

<p>HTML5 adds several new valid <code>type</code> attributes for <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements.  One of them, <code>number</code>, can be used to create a number picker.</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;input type="number" /&gt;
</code></p>

<p>This will present the user with a number picker in supported browsers, which, as of this writing includes Chrome, Safari, Opera, iOS, Opera Mobile, and Android 4.0+ (<a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-number">full support list</a>).  Here's what the user will see in supported browsers:</p>

<!--more-->


<h5>Chrome 20:</h5>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-07-15/Chrome.png" title="Chrome" alt="Chrome" /></p>

<h5>Safari 5.1.7:</h5>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-07-15/Safari.png" title="Safari" alt="Safari" /></p>

<h5>Opera 12.00:</h5>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-07-15/Opera.png" title="Opera" alt="Opera" /></p>

<h5>Opera Mobile 12:</h5>

<p><img alt="Opera Mobile" title="Opera Mobile" src="http://tjvantoll.com/images/posts/2012-07-15/Opera_Mobile.png" style="height: 250px;" /></p>

<h5>iOS 5:</h5>

<p><img alt="iOS" title="iOS" src="http://tjvantoll.com/images/posts/2012-07-15/iOS.png" style="height: 200px;" /></p>

<h5>Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean):</h5>

<p><img alt="Android" title="Android" src="http://tjvantoll.com/images/posts/2012-07-15/Android.png" style="height: 200px;" /></p>

<p>As you can see one of the nicest effects of using <code>[type=number]</code> is that mobile users will automatically be presented with a number pad to aid with entry of numeric data.  Unsupported browsers will simply treat the <code>input[type=number]</code> as a normal text input.  Firefox has <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=344616">recently added a UI-less version</a> of <code>input[type=number]</code> to their nightly builds so hopefully a fully enabled version will be coming soon.</p>

<p>You can see what your browser does below:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/XMEEz/1/embedded/result,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<h4>Additional Functionality</h4>

<p>The native number picker supports <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, and <code>step</code> attributes to allow you to pick the minimum value of the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, the maximum value of the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, and the amount the value should be incremented / decremented when the user spins through values (the <code>step</code> attribute defaults to <code>1</code> if not specified).</p>

<p>For example, on the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> below the browser will enforce that the minimum value will be <code>2</code>, the maximum value will be <code>20</code>, and the user will step at increments of <code>2</code>.</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;input type="number" min="2" max="20" step="2" /&gt;
</code></p>

<p>You can see how this behaves in your browser below:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/YmQFS/embedded/result,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>Just as a word of warning, Android 4.1 and iOS 5 do not support the <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, or <code>step</code> attributes.</p>

<h4>Methods</h4>

<p>In addition to the new attributes, supporting browsers also provide 3  JavaScript methods specifically for <code>input[type=number]</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>stepUp(n)</code> - Increment the <code>value</code> of the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> by <code>n</code>.</li>
<li><code>stepDown(n)</code> - Decrement the <code>value</code> of the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> by <code>n</code>.</li>
<li><code>valueAsNumber</code> - Retrieve the <code>value</code> of the <code>input</code> as a JavaScript <code>number</code> variable (by default retrieving the <code>value</code> of an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> returns a <code>string</code>).</li>
</ul>


<h3>jQuery UI Spinner</h3>

<p>jQuery UI's <code>spinner</code> is a new plugin due for jQuery UI's 1.9 release (currently in beta).  The plugin by default looks and behaves much like the native number picker.</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/scXYB/1/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>It also supports setting minimum, maximum, and step values through options rather than attributes.</p>

<p>``` html jQuery UI Spinner
<input id="spinner" /></p>

<script>
    $(function() {
        $('#spinner').spinner({
            min: 2,
            max: 20,
            step: 2
        });
    });
</script>


<p>```</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/N7UXT/2/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<h3>Above and Beyond</h3>

<p>What really sets jQuery UI's <code>spinner</code> apart from the native picker is that it is extensible, customizable, and it brings a number of extra features.  Here are some of the additional things that you can do.</p>

<h4>Paging</h4>

<p><code>spinner</code> takes a <code>page</code> option that allows you to define how much the <code>spinner</code> should step when the page down / page up keys are pressed.  The example below shows a <code>spinner</code> with a <code>step</code> value of <code>1</code> and a <code>page</code> value of <code>10</code>.</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/EvTeQ/1/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<h4>Mousewheel</h4>

<p>If you want mousewheel support for a <code>spinner</code> all you need to do is include <a href="https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel">Brandon Aaron's mousewheel plugin</a> and you get it automatically!  Try it out on any of the <code>spinner</code> demos on this page.</p>

<h4>Currency</h4>

<p>Ever need to accept currency at certain defined increments?  This example shows a <code>spinner</code> that spins through currency values at $25 increments, all with the same clean API.</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/2wEe6/3/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>The formatting is localized through <a href="https://github.com/jquery/globalize/">Globalize.js</a>, therefore, if you want to handle different currencies all you need to do is pass in the appropriate <code>culture</code> and include the necessary JavaScript dependencies.  Here's an example of an input that takes Euros.</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/ppH7g/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<h4>Time</h4>

<p>If you need to accept time data <code>spinner</code> can be used for that as well.</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/2wEe6/5/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>The <code>page</code> option discussed earlier is used nicely here to make the up / down keys control the minutes and the page up / page down keys to controls hours.  Try it out on the example above.</p>

<h3>24 Hour Times</h3>

<p>Since the <code>spinner</code> uses Globalize.js, you're free to use a time system different than the United States' nonsensical one.</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/Kenve/2/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<h3>Time Picker vs. <code>&lt;input type="time"&gt;</code></h3>

<p>HTML5 also provides a native time picker (<code>input[type=time]</code>), but, it has <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-datetime">nearly no support</a>, does not yet provide localized formatting, and does not provide the stepping/paging functionality that <code>spinner</code> has baked in.  In the future it might provide a viable native solution, but for now it's best to stay away.</p>

<h4>Extensible and Customizable</h4>

<p>Because <code>spinner</code> is built on top of <a href="http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory">jQuery UI's widget factory</a>, it is easily extensible.  For example, let's say you need to build an input that accepts a year in which the modern summer olympics were held.  You could do that with the following:</p>

<p>```javascript Extending spinner
<input /></p>

<script>
    $.widget( "tj.olympicspicker", $.ui.spinner, {
        options: {
            min: 1896,
            max: 2012,
            step: 4
        }
    });
    $(function() {
        $('input').olympicspicker();
    });
</script>


<p>```</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/EsTYd/1/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>Now all your olympics pickers in your code base can share the same code!</p>

<h3><code>&lt;input type="number"&gt;</code> vs. <code>spinner</code></h3>

<p>Although jQuery UI's <code>spinner</code> is more advanced and customizable, for most simple applications the native number picker will work just fine.  If you simply need a field that accepts numeric data there's no need to bring in <code>spinner</code> as a dependency.  However, if you do need the ability to fine tune the behavior and look of the picker, or if you need consistent UI across all browsers, jQuery UI's <code>spinner</code> provides an excellent API to do so.</p>

<p>To summarize the reasons to use the native picker are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easy to implement, simply give an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> a <code>type</code> attribute of <code>number</code>.</li>
<li>There are no dependencies, the number picker is native to the browser.</li>
<li>Mobile browsers that support the native picker will optimize the touch keyboard for number input.</li>
</ul>


<p>And the reasons to use jQuery UI's <code>spinner</code> are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Browser support - The <code>spinner</code> will work all the way back to IE6.</li>
<li>Extremely customizable and extensible.</li>
<li>Customizable handling of the page up and page down keys.</li>
<li>Easily integrated mousewheel support.</li>
<li>Built in custom types such as currency and time.</li>
<li>Built in i18n support.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Using jQuery UI's Spinner to Polyfill <code>input[type=number]</code></h3>

<p>Another option is to use the native HTML number picker when it's available, and fallback to jQuery UI's <code>spinner</code> when it's not.</p>

<p>``` javascript Using jQuery UI to Polyfill input[type=number]
$(function() {</p>

<pre><code>var input = document.createElement('input');
input.setAttribute('type', 'number');

if (input.type == 'text') {
    $('input[type=number]').spinner();
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>The code to detect <code>input[type=number]</code> support was taken from <a href="https://github.com/jonstipe/number-polyfill">another number picker polyfill by jonstipe</a>.  It creates an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, changes its <code>type</code> to <code>number</code>, and sees if that change actually took effect to determine whether the browser supports the type.  You could also use the <code>Modernizr.inputtypes.number</code> check from <a href="http://modernizr.com">Modernizr</a> to achieve the same thing.</p>

<p>The <code>spinner</code> plugin is smart enough to look for the <code>step</code>, <code>min</code>, and <code>max</code> attributes on the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> so you don't have to pass those in explictly (<a href="https://twitter.com/bassistance/status/225532234017406977">thanks @bassistance</a>).</p>

<p>The benefit of this technique is that you get the benefits of the native picker when it's available, and you can count on having a number picker in all browsers.  As a further optimization you could even use a conditional script loader such as <a href="yepnopejs.com">yepnope.js</a> to bring in jQuery UI's required JavaScript and CSS only when you need it.</p>

<h3>Using Spinner and Getting a Number Keyboard on Mobile</h3>

<p>If you want to use a <code>spinner</code> everywhere AND get a number keyboard on mobile things get a little trickier.  Mobile browsers look for an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> to have <code>type=number</code> to provide the number keyboard.  So you think this would be as simple as creating a <code>spinner</code> on a <code>&lt;input[type=number]&gt;</code> node.  However, that produces the following on supporting desktop browsers.</p>

<h5>Chrome 20:</h5>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-07-15/Chrome-Dual.png" title="Chrome" alt="Chrome" /></p>

<h5>Safari 5.1.7:</h5>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-07-15/Safari-Dual.png" title="Safari" alt="Safari" /></p>

<h5>Opera 12.00:</h5>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-07-15/Opera-Dual.png" title="Opera" alt="Opera" /></p>

<p>Obviously the double arrow UI is less than ideal.  So to work around this you simply need to hide or destroy one of the sets or controls... right?</p>

<p>Well it turns out hiding the native arrow controls is difficult because Chrome places the control on the inside of the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> and Safari and Opera place it on the outside.  Therefore, if you try to adjust the <code>margin</code> of the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> so jQuery UI's controls overlap the native ones it won't work in a cross browser friendly way.</p>

<p>Therefore the best approach I've came up with is to hide the <code>spinner</code>'s arrow controls when the browser creates its own.</p>

<p>``` javascript Number keyboard for a spinner
$(function() {</p>

<pre><code>$('input[type=number]').spinner();
if (Modernizr.input.step) {
    $('.ui-spinner-button').hide();
    $('.ui-spinner-input').css('marginRight', 0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>What this does is detect whether the browser supports the <code>step</code> attribute, if it does it removes jQuery UI's controls.  What does the <code>step</code> attribute have to do with the arrow controls?  Nothing, except that it just <em>happens</em> that the browsers that support the <code>step</code> attribute also create a native control to do the stepping.  Is this going to change in the future?  Quite possibly.</p>

<p>So obviously this is not ideal, and probably shouldn't be used in production code, but it works at the moment.  Have a better approach for tackling this problem?  Let me know in the comments.</p>
