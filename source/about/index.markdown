Hi!  I'm Ted VanToll.  I'm a Web Developer working for [Liquid Web](http://liquidweb.com) in Lansing, MI.  I've been making web sites since the web was a thing and I have experience building things ranging from major applications for Fortune 500 companies to small personal sites and everything in between.

I'm a big open source advocate and have made some minor contributions to a few open source libraries that I use.  This blog itself is open source and if you'd like to [dig around the source](https://github.com/tjvantoll/tjvantoll.github.com/tree/source) to see how I've made it you're free to.

If you're looking to contact me, email me at [tj.vantoll@gmail.com](mailto:tj.vantoll@gmail.com) or contact me via Twitter ([@tjvantoll](https://twitter.com/tjvantoll)).
