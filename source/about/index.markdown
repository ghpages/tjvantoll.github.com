I'm a web developer in Lansing, MI.  By day I program for Auto-Owners Insurance, where I build insurancey web applications.  By night, I play with front end stuff and have been getting involved in the open source community.

I have a wonderful girlfriend (who's also a programmer), twin boys (who might be doomed to become programmers), and a pair of standard poodles (who despite my best efforts can't grasp the basics of programming).

On an unrelated note, I'm the "2006 World Machine Dance Champion".  You can check out some of my old videos [here](http://www.youtube.com/user/tj3inc).
